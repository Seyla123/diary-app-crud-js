## Project Overview

CRUD Diary is designed as a user-friendly, multi-page application with the following key components:

1. **Login Page**: Secure user authentication.
2. **Sign Up Page**: User registration for new accounts.
3. **Dashboard**: Overview of entries and users, displaying the total number of entries and users with the most recent entries (up to 8).
4. **Main Page**: Core CRUD functionalities with a form to add new entries and a section displaying all existing entries.

The application leverages front-end technologies to perform all operations and stores data on the client-side, eliminating the need for a backend server.

### Git-Flow Branching Strategy

1. **Main Branch**:
   - Represents the stable production code.
   - Direct changes are avoided here.

2. **Feature Branches**:
   - Used for developing new features or fixing bugs.
   - Derived from and merged back into the `develop` branch.

3. **Development (Develop) Branch**:
   - Contains the latest development code.
   - Prepares features for the next release.

4. **Release Branches**:
   - For final tweaks and testing before release.
   - Merged back into both `main` and `develop`.

5. **Bugfix Branches**:
   - Address specific issues without disrupting ongoing development.

6. **Hotfix Branches**:
   - For urgent fixes to the production code, branched directly from `main`.

### Git-Flow Steps

1. **Create a Remote Repository**:
   - Set up a new repository on GitHub.

2. **Initialize a Local Repository**:
   - Use Git to initialize and link your local repository:
     ```bash
     git init
     git remote add origin <repository_URL>
     ```

3. **Work on Feature Branches**:
   - Create and work on a new feature branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout develop
     git flow feature start feature_name
     ```
   - Commit and push changes:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Commit message"
     git flow feature publish feature_name
     ```

4. **Merge and Complete Features**:
   - Merge completed features back into `develop`:
     ```bash
     git flow feature finish feature_name
     ```

5. **Manage Releases and Bugfixes**:
   - Follow similar steps for handling releases and bugfixes.

6. **Apply Hotfixes**:
   - For critical production issues:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git flow hotfix start hotfix_name
     ```

   - Merge hotfixes into both `main` and `develop`:
     ```bash
     git flow hotfix finish hotfix_name
     ```

### Additional Git Commands

- **Tracking and Rebasing**:
  - Track remote branches and rebase your work:
    ```bash
    git flow feature track <feature_name>
    git checkout feature/branch_name
    git rebase develop
    ```

- **Merging and Resetting**:
  - Merge branches and reset to specific commits:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge develop
    git reset <commit_hash>
    ```

- **Remote and Commit History**:
  - View and manage remote branches and commit history:
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    git log
    ```
